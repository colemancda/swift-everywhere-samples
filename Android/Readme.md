## Usage

1. Make sure that file `local.properties` has proper paths (usually paths already set by `Android Studio`):

   - sdk.dir - Path to Android SDK (by default similar to: /Users/user/Library/Android/sdk)
   - ndk.dir - Path to Android NDK (by default similar to: /Users/user/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle)

2. Copy file `local.properties.yml.template` to `local.properties.yml`. Update file `local.properties.yml` with proper paths:

   - swiftToolchain.dir - Path to Swift Toolchain (by default similar to: /Users/user/git/swift-everywhere-toolchain/ToolChain/swift-android-toolchain)

3. Open project in Android Studio and run on Device or Simulator.
